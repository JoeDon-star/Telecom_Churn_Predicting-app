# Telecom_Churn_Predicting-app

A simple web application that predicts whether a telecom customer is likely to churn.
Built with Python, Machine Learning, and Streamlit.

### 🔗 Live Demo:
👉 https://telecomchurn-app.streamlit.app

### 📘 Overview

This project uses machine learning to analyze customer data and determine if a customer is likely to stop using the telecom service.
The app is built with Streamlit, allowing users to easily upload data and get instant predictions through a simple interface.

### 🚀 Features

- 🧠 Predict customer churn in real-time

- 📤 Upload CSV customer data

- 📊 Clean, user-friendly interface

- 📈 Uses a trained Random Forest model

- 🔧 Runs on Streamlit for fast deployment

### 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used

 - Python 3

- Pandas, NumPy

- Scikit-learn (Random Forest Classifier)

- Streamlit

- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for EDA, optional)

- Pickle (to save the model)

- Git & GitHub

### 🛠️ How to Run the App Locally

Clone the repository:
```
git clone <https://github.com/JoeDon-star/Telecom_Churn_Predicting-app.git>
cd <Telecom_Churn_Predicting-app>
```

Install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the Streamlit app:
```
streamlit run app.py
```
### 🧩 How the App Works

- User opens the web app

- Uploads a CSV file or inputs values manually

- App preprocesses the data

- Loaded model (model.pkl) predicts churn

- Results are displayed with interpretation

### 📈 Future Improvements

- Add more ML models (XGBoost, LightGBM)

- Improve UI with Streamlit themes

- Add data visualization dashboard

- Add model explainability (SHAP values)

- Allow users to download prediction results

### Conclusion
This telecom churn prediction app demonstrates how machine learning can help businesses understand customer behavior and reduce churn. With an easy-to-use interface and a reliable prediction model, the tool provides quick insights that support smarter decision-making.
